title: Grow Customer Loyalty the Unintuitive Way
excerpt: As marketers we like to think that customer loyalty comes from a combination of our fantastic customer support, superior product, and retention based marketing schemes like loyalty programmes. The reality however, is less intuitive.

We all like to think that if we research our customer, understand their needs, and deliver beautiful products that meet those needs, that people will like our product. If we also provide incredible customer service and offer incentives to our most loyal customers then surely people will love our product and brand. Surely if we do all that our customers will be loyal.

## A Most Loved Brand

Apple is consistently valued as one of the '[most valuable brands](https://www.forbes.com/sites/martyswant/2020/07/27/apple-microsoft-and-other-tech-giants-top-forbes-2020-most-valuable-brands-list/?sh=4fb9ea283ada)' in the world. A lot of people would say that Apple customers tend to love the brand more than other brands. Even before the iPod and iPhone the term 'Apply fanboy' would get thrown around, and later the 'iSheep' was used. Surely then, Apple customers would be more loyal than your average customer?

Well, not really. Looking at data from the early 2000s (I would love to see more recent numbers if anyone has any), Macintosh computers experienced customer loyalty (expressed in repeat purchases) that was more or less line with their market share. Dell, at the time had a far more penetration in the computer market, and so had a higher rate of repeat purchases. Apple's rate of repeat purchase was slightly higher than you would expect given it's market share which might be due to vendor lock-in from Mac OS moreso than customer loyalty. Any way you look at it Apple fanboys weren't really any more fanatical than any other brands fans.

Even the Apple iPhone - one of the most loved products ever has [customer loyalty in line with market share](https://www.marketingscience.info/iphone-defy-double-jeopardy-law/). This isn't to say that people don't love great products, and prefer some brands over others. What it does highlight however is [the law of double jeopardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_jeopardy_(marketing)). Brands with high penetration have more customers, and those customers tend to exhibit more loyalty. Woe is the small brand.

## What Loyal Customers Really Love

Regardless of 'brand love' it's clear that customer loyalty is largely a function of market penetration, not our loyalty marketing efforts. Regardless of this, loyal customers do still exist. Apple computers might not have had a higher proportion of loyal customers than Dell did, but perhaps those loyal customers they did have were more devout, spending larger amounts of the income on the Apple brand than the Dell customers. If this is the case, then there might still be good cause to keep loyalty marketing efforts in tact.

Sadly, the opposite of this is true. The most loyal customers, tend to be of little value to a brand, often spending the least. [One research paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306009341_Do_loyal_customers_really_pay_more_for_services) looked into service business, in this case airlines, finding that customers with high behavioural loyalty were also the most price sensitive. We shouldn't ignore these customers, but developing expensive marketing initiatives for what is in reality a low value segment of the market would be wasteful.

Harley Davidson's loyal fans show similar purchasing behaviour as the airline's loyal customers. Often this audience is lauded as highly loyal and lucrative to the brand, but research shows that in fact the opposite is true. Harley Davidson owners that have owned multiple Harley Davidson bikes and believe that x and y, are also price sensitive. They opt to purchase second hand bikes at a much higher rate than the average Harley Davidson owner making them a far less valuable customer for the brand. Perhaps the obsession with appealing to and positioning against this segment is why the brand has struggled for so many years.

## Be Pragmatic



There's almost something more honorable in being straght up and not trying to offer loyalty schemes. You're out here trying to make money, and customers are out there trying to solve their problems (and possibly a few dollars), it can be a good healthy relationship, but it's a pretty casual one.
