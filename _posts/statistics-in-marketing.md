# Work in Progress

Over the past ten or so years we have seen new marketing technology mature and digital transformation amplify the amount of data avaialble to marketers, and also greatly increase it's accesiblity. While this is all good news for the profession, an important consideration often goes missing - more data doesn't make it *easier* to make well informed decisions, it makes it harder. While it becomes easy to tell a story with a large pool of data to draw from, it becomes much harder to tell an accurate story.

## Digital Media Metrics

### Measuring People's Opportunity to See Ads

#### Impressions

We have been tracking impressions for a long time in media, well before digital advertising. Across different media channels the most broad definition of an impression is that it is the number of times an ad had an opportunitity to be seen. For TV we would look at the number of people who tuned into the channel a spot ran at during the time when the spot aired and count all of the people as an impression. In print we would look at the readership for the newspaper where an ad ran and count all the readers as impressions. We don't know if these TV viewers or paper readers saw or noticed our ad, but they were likely to have had the opportunitiy to see our ad.

Impressions alone aren't typically a very important metric in offline media channels, but because of a lack of anything better, and how digital media is typically traded, impressions have become quite an important number to keep an eye on. Unfortunatley in digital media the defintino of an imperssion gets applied quite poorly. For example Google simplifies the definition of an impression on their platform as '[How often your ad is shown](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6320)'. They go into slightly more (although still insufficient) detail on the technicalities of how the metric is put together, but the first definition offered is the one that sticks for most people and it's misleading - if I am *shown* and ad, I expect it to be *visible*, but a lot of impressions delivered with Google never display on a users screen.

#### Viewability

To improve on the impression metric in digital media, a definition of what a 'viewable' impression was made. It's a low bar - 50% of an ad on screen for one second (two seconds if it's a video). Most decent ad platforms can report on this metric, but always choose to nudge users towards reporting on raw impression numbers instead.

The obvious question at this point is how viewable are ads on the internet? Well, lower than you think. Across all ad placements run with Google viewability averages out to around 50%. That means half the ads run on the internet likely never even entered a users screen. Next time someone reports impressions back to you check whether you are looking at viewable impressions or not.

### Conversions

Most digital media platforms can track website event data and media marry it up with media data so that they can report on the number of people who have seen or clicked an ad, and triggered an event (such as filling out a form).

Having access to this kind of data is often what people point to as evidence that online media is 'better' than offline media. It's like magic, by tracking conversions we can measure the business outcomes that come from our media which is all we could ever hope for.
