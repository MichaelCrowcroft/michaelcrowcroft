title: Lies, Damned Lies, and Marketing Statistics
excerpt: We often tell a story in digital media using metrics like impressions (and by extension reach), and conversions. For brand building lots of impressions, means high reach & frequency which means we are delivering awarness. For performance media conversion tracking means we can fine tune our advertising to drive business results. What if this is all painfully untrue though?

Over the past ten or so years we have seen new marketing technology mature and digital transformation amplify the amount of data avaialble to marketers. While this should be good news for the profession, an important consideration often goes missing - more data doesn't make it *easier* to make well informed decisions, it makes it harder. It becomes easy invent stories with a large pool of data to draw from, but it becomes much harder to tell an honest one.

There's a lot that could (and has) been said on metrics in digital media, and to me the most troubling aspect of them is the most simple. That is just *what* do the metrics actually mean? With impressions and conversions I'm consistently impressed at how often I see these metrics misrepresented in reports and then joked about (usually behind a client's back).

## Impressions

We have been tracking impressions for a long time in media, well before digital advertising. Across different media channels the most broad definition of an impression is that it is the number of times an ad had an opportunitity to be seen. For TV we would look at the number of people who tuned into the channel a spot ran at during the time when the spot aired, and count all of the people as an impression. In print we would look at the readership for the newspaper where an ad ran, and count all the readers as impressions. We don't know if these TV viewers or paper readers saw or noticed our ad, but they were likely to have had the opportunitiy to see our ad.

Impressions alone aren't typically a very important metric in offline media channels, but because of a lack of anything better, and how digital media is typically traded, impressions have become a common metric to report on. Unfortunatley in digital media the defintion of an imperssion gets applied quite poorly. For example, Google simplifies the definition of an impression on their platform as '[How often your ad is shown](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6320)'. They usually go into slightly more (although still insufficient) detail on the technicalities of how the metric is put together, but the first definition offered is the one that sticks for most people and it's misleading - if I am *shown* an ad, I expect it to be *visible*, but many impressions delivered with Google never display on a users screen.

To improve on the impression metric in digital media, a definition of what a 'viewable' impression was made. It's a low bar - 50% of an ad on screen for one second (two seconds if it's a video). Most ad platforms can report on this metric (although a whole [third-party industry exists](https://headerbidding.co/viewability-vendors-for-publishers/) because no one ad sellers to measure things honestly), but most choose to nudge users towards reporting on raw impression numbers instead.

One point to consider is how viewable are ads on the internet on average? Well, lower than you think. For all ad placements run across Google's display networks [viewability averages out to around 50%](https://www.adexchanger.com/data-exchanges/google-viewability-benchmark-more-than-half-of-all-ads-arent-seen/) (publishers have been working to increase this number so it might not be quite so low anymore). That means around half the ads run on the internet likely never even entered a users screen - that is to say, did not have the opportunity to be seen. Next time someone reports impressions back to you check whether you are being shown the number of *viewable* impressions or not.

## Conversions

>Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half.

Most digital media platforms can track website event data and marry it up with media data so that you can report on the number of people who have seen or clicked an ad, and then triggered an event (such as filling out a form on your website).

Having access to this kind of data is generally what is help up as evidence that online media is 'better' than offline media. It's like magic, by tracking conversions we can measure the business outcomes that come from our media - the old problem above has apparently been solved.

Of course life can't be that simple though. Firstly, nothing happens in a vacuum. One ad platform might notice that someone has clicked an ad and then filled out a form, and so counts one conversion. Occasionaly however, another ad platform might have also seen the same person click on ad that it served, it also counts one conversion and now we're counting one conversion twice.

On the other hand there's also all the marketing that *can't* track conversions. If someone sees a TV ad three times then clicks a Google Search ad, it doesn't seem like that Google ad should be getting much credit for the conversion. For large brands in particular this is a huge problem.

Of course smart people will point to attribution modelling as a good answer to these problems, but these models still don't capture offline media's effectiveness properly. Even within digital media competing ad platforms won't talk to each other well enough to build a proper model (I'm still yet to see a functioning one in real life). Really though, if we're going to build some kind of predictive model to measure media effectiveness it seems a bit short sighted to use platform 'conversion' metrics as an input anyway.

## Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, yes more data made available to marketers more quickly is a good thing, and digital media generally delivers that. Marketers need to be careful about how they interpret this data though, and understand what the numbers really mean. Often, marketers try to derive too much meaning from the numbers digital media provides them, and they don't take the time to look for more in depth, meaningful data.

Thinking about all the different teams I've worked with, most marketers are aware of these problems with digital media metrics, but still gravitate towards them. Partly, I think this is because the numbers are easy to get a hold of, and by reporting on them marketing campaigns *feel* more tangible. However, I also think it's a sign that digital media companies are doing a good job of selling digital media while traditional publishers and agencies are not.
