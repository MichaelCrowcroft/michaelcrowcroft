# Work in Progress

Over the past ten or so years we have seen new marketing technology mature and digital transformation amplify the amount of data avaialble to marketers, and also greatly increase it's accesiblity. While this is all good news for the profession, an important consideration often goes missing - more data doesn't make it *easier* to make well informed decisions, it makes it harder. While it becomes easy to tell a story with a large pool of data to draw from, it becomes much harder to tell an accurate story.

## Digital Media Metrics

Pretty much all digital media platforms have their own analytics platform backed in. These platforms are designed so that events on a website can be tracked and monitored. By tracking website event data the media platforms marry it up with media data and then report on the number of people who have seen or clicked an ad, and triggered an event (such as filling out a form).

At a glance this seems like the perfect way to gauge media effectiveness and cut back on media wastage. Immedietly marketers pull out there calculators and begin tracking cost per conversions. If $1,000 on Facebook delivers 10 conversions, then we have a cost per conversion of $100 - if a conversion is worth $200 then we have a return on ad spend of $2. From this we can plan and forecast into the future. If we want 50 conversions we need $5,000 - easy!
